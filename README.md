# Serbo/Croatian Crash Course
A Collection of language learning resources, tools, and data for Serbo-Croatian

The Goal is conversation first learning. Ideally, communicating ideas in 2 - 4 months. By focusing on the most common words immediately, communicating ideas early will be possible _(albeit with awful grammer)_

### Methodology
 - Memorize _(SRS/Flash Cards/Whatever)_ the top ~1000 words / short phrases.
 - Speak the language with native speakers from the start.
 - Progress on grammer, reading, writing after the inital rough conversations are happening.
