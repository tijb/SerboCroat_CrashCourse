# Accelerated Serbian Learning Course

## Currently working on:
I am currently building out the Croatian Serbian deck.

I will be adding and updating files as I learn languages or am interesting in a language.
People are free to add their own folders, and to review and correct any errors in existing
files.

## How to use with anki
    - in anki, go to import file
    - make sure the delimiter is set to Tabs
    - ideally choose the double sided deck option. (with reverse cards)
