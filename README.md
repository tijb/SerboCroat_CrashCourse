# Accelerated Language Crash Course

### Anki + Ogden Basic

## Currently working on:
I am currently building out the Croatian Serbian deck.

I will be adding and updating files as I learn languages or am interesting in a language. People are free to add their
own folders, and to review and correct any errors in existing files.

## Method
Using the ogden basic english manual as a guide for a stripped down essentials only version of english, we directly
translate each item into the desired languages for learning to get a strong foundation for the desired language.

Ogden Basic English contains only 850 words. It is deemed to be the most essential subset of english for effective
communication. This will probably not translate perfectly into the every other language, but the hope is, that with a
few tweaks (perhaps an extras.csv, or two) this should get you to the point in your desired language where you can
communicate effectively. though your grammer will be poor, and this course does not attempt to assist you with that.

## How to use with anki
In the anki desktop app you are able to import a file. If you do this, create a new deck, and ideally choose "Basic (and
reversed card)" as the deck type. You can use the defaults of "Field 1" mapped to "Front" and "Field 2" mapped to back
if you wish to have english as the default. Otherwise you will want to flip them.

## Structure
```
template/ - contains the template files to fill out with translations.

... - all other folders are translations for specific languages.
```
